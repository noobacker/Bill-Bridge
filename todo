1. AI to analyse the code and features and scope of improvement.
2. Since, Invoice date can be modified (keep backdate) while creating a invoice, and creation date is the current time. but this might ffect in global level distribution. so lets add a feature in the settings named "Buisness Region selection", here whichever region is selected that time will be recorded for any activity or creation in the system logs.

5. Inventory Page - In "Raw Materials" and "Production Inventory", do the pagination - default to 10/n with options of 10,20,50.
6. Transport page count update.
7. Image in invoice.
8. Calling feature.

Suggestions / Potential Improvements (from AI scan):

1. Dashboard
   - Add pagination or lazy loading for long tables (sales, expenses, inventory) to keep pages fast on large data.
   - Show quick KPIs for overdue credit payments and upcoming deliveries.

2. Expenses
   - Add an "Export to Excel/CSV" for filtered expenses list.
   - Allow attaching a bill photo/PDF to each expense for record keeping.

3. Sales & Clients
   - On client details, show lifetime total sales and outstanding amount.
   - Add a quick filter for "Credit" invoices on the sales page.

4. Inventory / Production
   - Flag production batches that were added with "Don't record raw material" so they’re easy to audit later.
   - Add a simple stock valuation card (total bricks * default price) on inventory dashboard.

5. Settings / UX
   - Add a small preview of invoice PDF layout in Settings when switching between formats.
   - Add tooltips for tax fields (CGST/SGST/IGST) explaining when to use each.

6. Potential Bugs / Edge Cases
   - Validate that company name is never saved as empty string (should always fallback to "BillBridge").
   - Double‑check payment status flows so changing status doesn’t double‑count in reports.



   Add the pagination in
1. "Raw Materials" 
2. "Production Inventory" and 
3. "Partners's" - Vendors, Clients, Transportation
 (default set to 10- show options of 30, 50, 100)

Pagination, similar to Sales page.
